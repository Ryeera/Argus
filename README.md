# DragoBot
Hi there, I am DragoBot!
I am here to make your server a lot more organized when it comes to voice-channels!  

When you add me to your server, I will add a text-channel for each voice-channel, where people can chat over stuff in said voice-channel. You know, for all these YouTube-links, images, memes and so on talked about in the conversation.  

But here comes the catch: These text-channels are invisible until you actually join the voice-channel! This has the upside, that noone can see or write in the text-channel, unless they are in the voice-channel (or an admin, sorry I can't do anything about that ^^").  

And if that wasn't enough yet, I can also create temporary voice-channels with just one command!

## Add me!
You can add my to your Discord-Server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=655496558095237130&permissions=285232144&scope=bot)

## Setup
When you invite me to your server, I will send a message, which explains anything. Have any public channel containing the word "bot" ready for me and I will find it.

## Commands
Simply say `d!help` in any channel I can see and I will tell you everything!

## FAQ
**Why does DragoBot need the Manage Roles permission?**  
Manage Roles allows me to change permission-overrides in Text-Channels. I won't change anything in your role-system, and if you don't trust me, you can move my role all the way to the bottom, I'll still do my thing ^^

**Why does DragoBot need the Manage Channels permission?**  
I need this role to create temporary voice-channels. If you don't want to use this feature, you can remove this permission.

**Why does DragoBot need the Move Members perimission?**  
Although this feature is not implemented yet, I will be able to move members into their temporary voice-channel if they create one while connected to another voice-channel.

**Why does DragoBot not work with some channels?**  
You need to make sure that I have access to the category and/or channel in question. If you, for example, made an mod-channel, that only mods can access, I won't have access to that at first. You need to manually add another permission-override to let me access the channel. For that, I have my own role called "DragoBot"!

## Planned Features
- Private Voice-Channels
- More Options
  - Instead of assigning permissions to an existing text-channel, create a new text-channel (more organized for admins)
  - Format Logging
  - Create Master-text-channel for copying permissions (for example so that mods can always see the text-channels)
